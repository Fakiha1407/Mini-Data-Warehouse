# Mini-Data-Warehouse
Data Warehouse for Sales and Product Analytics

## Overview

This project demonstrates building a **mini data warehouse** to analyze sales, products, and customers using *SQL*, *pandas*, and *visualizations*. The dataset consists of customer, product, and sales information, which is stored in a SQLite database. SQL queries are used to gain insights and generate various reports. Visualizations are created using *matplotlib* and *seaborn*
## Required Packages
Pandas
faker
seaborn
matplotlib
sqlite3
## Data Sets
Three data sets are generated with pandas and faker packages
customer.csv
products.csv
sales.csv
## SQL Queries insights
This project includes the following key queries to gain insights from the data:

## Total Revenue by Product: A bar chart showing the revenue breakdown for each product.

## Revenue by Category: A pie chart showing the revenue distribution across product categories.

## Top 5 Customers by Total Spend: A horizontal bar chart showing the top 5 customers based on their total spend.

## Average Quantity Sold per Product: A query showing the average quantity sold for each product, helping to understand the product demand.

## Sales Performance by Region: A query that breaks down the total sales by region to identify where most products are sold.

## Running the Analysis
Open the Jupyter notebook notebooks/DataWarehouse_Mini.ipynb to explore the analysis, run SQL queries, and visualize the results.

The SQL queries extract valuable insights about total revenue, product performance, customer spending, and more.

Visualizations are generated with matplotlib and seaborn to provide a clear understanding of the data.
